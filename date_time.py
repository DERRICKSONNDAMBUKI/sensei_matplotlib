# Working with dates and times
# Many interesting data sets have a date or time as the x-
# value. Pythonâ€™s datetime module helps you work with this
# kind of data.

date_string = dt.strftime(today, '%m/%d/%y')
print(date_string )

print('\n# Generating a specific date')
# You can also generate a datetime object for any date and time you
# want. The positional order of arguments is year, month, and day.
# The hour, minute, second, and microsecond arguments are
# optional.

# Datetime formatting arguments
# The strftime() function generates a formatted string from a
# datetime object, and the strptime() function genereates a
# datetime object from a string. The following codes let you work with
# dates exactly as you need to.
# %A  Weekday name, such as Monday
# %B  Month name, such as January
# %m  Month, as a number (01 to 12)
# %d  Day of the month, as a number (01 to 31)
# %Y  Four-digit year, such as 2016
# %y  Two-digit year, such as 16
# %H  Hour, in 24-hour format (00 to 23)
# %I  Hour, in 12-hour format (01 to 12)
# %p  AM or PM
# %M  Minutes (00 to 59)
# %S  Seconds (00 to 61)
